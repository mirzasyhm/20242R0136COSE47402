# **SARCMeme - Sarcasm-Aware CLIP and RoBERTa based Multimodal Hateful Meme Classification**


## **Introduction**
SARCMeme is a novel multimodal deep learning framework designed for hateful meme classification. The model integrates Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining (CLIP) for vision-language embeddings with a RoBERTa-based sarcasm detection module, enabling nuanced interpretation of text and visual cues. This project addresses the challenges of detecting hateful memes, particularly those employing sarcasm, and aims to improve classification performance through a robust multimodal architecture.
